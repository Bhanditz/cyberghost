## Files

Configuration files for the DNS and FTP servers are under `/config`. There is also an example of an internal network configuration using VirtualBox.  
Malware source code is under `/src/malware`.  
Sorce code for the DNS side, including GUI, is under `/src/dns_side`.

## Dependencies

Python 2.7  
[py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org) module for creating an executable file.  
[pycrypto](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml) module for encryption.

## How to run

Assuming there is a working local or virtual network (including DNS and FTP servers), execute the following files:  
1. `listen_malwares.py` on the DNS side  
2. `GUI.py` on the DNS side  
3. Run the malware on the target machine (using Python or the executable file generated by py2exe)  
Note: It may be necessary to change IP addresses and/or FTP configuration in the source code.
